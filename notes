# Operators
**  Exponent                              2**3 = 8
%   Modulus/remainder                     22 % 8 = 6
//  Integer division/floored quotient     22 // 8 = 2
/   Division
*   Multiplication
-   Subtraction
+   Addition

# Functions

str()
int()
float()

# Comparison Operators

==    Equal To
!=    Not equal to
<     Less than
<=    Less than or equal to
>     Greater than
>=    Greater than or equal to


# Booleans and more

and
or
not
True
False
None      # Used when a value explicitly returnes to 'none'

# Flow control

if
elif
else

# Loops

while     # loop while something
break     # Breaks the loop
continue  # breaks the loop but will go  back to last flow control if possible or continue w/ program
return    # The value that a function call evaluates to - contains value or expression that the function should return to (exit code or phrase or whatever)

for loop  # Used to cycle through values like below

for i in $list:
  print $i
  
# Variables
global $varname     # The global statement is intended to for a function to modify a global variable 

# Error Handling
try                 # The script will attempt the code, if it can't complete it, you will need to create an exception to the try
except              # Used to handle errors - can put logs or exit the script once the exception is found/met
